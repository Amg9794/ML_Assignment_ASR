# Introduction

Objective: The project aims to leverage OpenAI's Whisper model—an advanced ASR system—to accurately transcribe complex Supreme Court hearing dialogues. By fine-tuning the model on a specialized dataset, we seek to address the challenges posed by courtroom hearings, such as multiple speakers, overlapping conversations, and domain-specific legal jargon.

Outcome: The goal is to develop a robust data pipeline capable of handling segmented and speaker-dependent audio, ensuring high precision in capturing every word spoken during legal proceedings. This will contribute to maintaining the integrity of legal records in a domain where accuracy is extremely important.
